      "question": "Given the regular expression (a|b)*c, provide the corresponding NFA.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A simple NFA with states for 'a' and 'b'.",
        "b": "An NFA recognizing zero or more occurrences of 'a' or 'b' followed by 'c'.",
        "c": "An NFA recognizing 'a' or 'b' followed by zero or more occurrences of 'c'.",
        "d": "An NFA recognizing 'ab' followed by 'c'."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Too simplistic for the given regular expression.",
        "b": "Correct! The regular expression (a|b)*c represents zero or more occurrences of 'a' or 'b' followed by 'c'.",
        "c": "This describes 'a' or 'b' followed by zero or more 'c's, not the language of the given regular expression.",
        "d": "This represents 'abc', not the language of the given regular expression."

      "question": "Explain the role of epsilon transitions in NFAs during the conversion of a regular expression to an NFA.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Epsilon transitions are not used in NFAs.",
        "b": "Epsilon transitions allow the NFA to transition between states without consuming input.",
        "c": "Epsilon transitions force the NFA to accept any input symbol.",
        "d": "Epsilon transitions are only used in DFAs, not NFAs."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Epsilon transitions are commonly used in NFAs.",
        "b": "Correct! Epsilon transitions allow the NFA to transition between states without consuming input.",
        "c": "Epsilon transitions do not force the NFA to accept any input symbol.",
        "d": "Epsilon transitions are used in both NFAs and DFAs."

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Kleene star (*) in a regular expression and how does it affect the corresponding NFA?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The Kleene star represents alternation in a regular expression.",
        "b": "The Kleene star denotes zero or more occurrences of the preceding element, and it results in loops in the NFA.",
        "c": "The Kleene star represents the end of a regular expression.",
        "d": "The Kleene star forces the NFA to recognize only a single occurrence of the preceding element."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The Kleene star represents repetition, not alternation.",
        "b": "Correct! The Kleene star denotes zero or more occurrences of the preceding element, and it results in loops in the NFA.",
        "c": "The Kleene star does not represent the end of a regular expression.",
        "d": "The Kleene star allows for multiple occurrences, not just a single one."
