### Aim of the Experiment 

To **construct an equivalent Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) from a given Regular Expression (RE)** using **Thompsonâ€™s Construction method**.  
This experiment illustrates the systematic procedure of converting regular expressions into NFAs, which is fundamental in **pattern matching, lexical analysis, and compiler design**.
