### Aim of the experiment

The objective of this experiment is to explore and implement the conversion of a given Regular Expression (RE) into its equivalent Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) using Thompson’s Construction method. The experiment focuses on illustrating the step-by-step transformation process, helping learners understand how regular expressions can be systematically represented as finite automata — a fundamental concept in pattern recognition and lexical analysis within computational theory.
