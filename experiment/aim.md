<u><h3>Aim of the experiment</h3></u>
To study and implement the conversion of a given Regular Expression (RE) into its equivalent Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) using Thompsonâ€™s Construction method. This experiment aims to demonstrate the step-by-step transformation process, ensuring a clear understanding of how regular expressions are represented as finite automata for pattern recognition and lexical analysis in computational theory.
